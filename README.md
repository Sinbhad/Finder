Application to assist employees when locating product with a visual aid. 

Created this with Windows forms to help employees in our warhouse find product, 
whether to be put away or just to find it.

We previously used an Excel sheet to store the locations, though we quickly outgrew this.
I included an excel sheet with some sample data, once downloaded you will need to update the path. 

You can use the forms editor to reposition the layout if needed.
