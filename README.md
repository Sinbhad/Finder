Application to assist employees when locating product with a visual aid. 

Created this with Windows forms to help employees in our warhouse find product, 
whether to be put away or just to find it.

We previously used an Excel sheet to store the locations, though we quickly outgrew this.
I included an excel sheet with some sample data, once downloaded you will need to update the path. 

There is also an issues text file that allows users to inform us that a location is incorrect or needs to be updated
While the user could be allowed to update on their own, we were concerened of the risks this might introduce. 
^^The path on this file will also need to be updated 

You can use the forms editor to reposition the layout if needed.
